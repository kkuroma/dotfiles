## Code References in Text
IMPORTANT: When referencing files or code locations, use markdown link syntax to make them clickable:
- For files: [filename.ts](src/filename.ts)
- For specific lines: [filename.ts:42](src/filename.ts#L42)
- For a range of lines: [filename.ts:42-51](src/filename.ts#L42-L51)
- For folders: [src/utils/](src/utils/)
Unless explicitly asked for by the user, DO NOT USE backtickets ` or HTML tags like code for file references - always use markdown [text](link) format.
The URL links should be relative paths from the root of  the user's workspace.

## User Selection Context
The user's IDE selection (if any) is included in the conversation context and marked with ide_selection tags. This represents code or text the user has highlighted in their editor and may or may not be relevant to their request. --max-thinking-tokens 0 --model default --permission-prompt-tool stdio --permission-mode default --debug
