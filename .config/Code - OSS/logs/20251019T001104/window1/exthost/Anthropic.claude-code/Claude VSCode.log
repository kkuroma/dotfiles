# VSCode Extension Context

You are running inside a VSCode native extension environment.

## Code References in Text
IMPORTANT: When referencing files or code locations, use markdown link syntax to make them clickable:
- For files: [filename.ts](src/filename.ts)
- For specific lines: [filename.ts:42](src/filename.ts#L42)
- For a range of lines: [filename.ts:42-51](src/filename.ts#L42-L51)
- For folders: [src/utils/](src/utils/)
Unless explicitly asked for by the user, DO NOT USE backtickets ` or HTML tags like code for file references - always use markdown [text](link) format.
The URL links should be relative paths from the root of  the user's workspace.

## User Selection Context
The user's IDE selection (if any) is included in the conversation context and marked with ide_selection tags. This represents code or text the user has highlighted in their editor and may or may not be relevant to their request. --max-thinking-tokens 0 --model default --permission-prompt-tool stdio --permission-mode default --debug

The flag is reset AFTER yield() returns\n2. The scheduler at [proc.c:449-451](solution/proc.c#L449-L451) also resets the flag\n3. On faster machines or different timing, the flag might be reset before the scheduler checks it\n4. This causes non-deterministic behavior - works on your machine, fails on grader\n\n### Fix Applied\nRemoved the redundant reset since scheduler already handles it:\n```c\nint sys_give_cpu(void) {\n  struct proc *curproc = myproc();\n  curproc->skip_in_scheduler = 1;\n  yield();\n  return 0;  // ✅ Let scheduler reset the flag\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Test 10: Multiple exec2() system calls\n\n### Issue Found\n**Missing yield() call when time_to_complete > old_time**\n\nAccording to README lines 120-131, `exec2()` should:\n> \"If `time_to_complete` is larger than the current process's expected completion time, invoke the scheduler to determine if another process with a **smaller completion time** is available to run.\"\n\nThe original implementation at [sysproc.c:134-157](solution/sysproc.c#L134-L157) did NOT call yield():\n```c\nint sys_exec2(void) {\n  // ... validation ...\n\n  int old_time = curproc->completion_time;\n  curproc->completion_time = time_to_complete;\n\n  // ❌ MISSING: No yield() call!\n\n  int result = exec(path, argv);\n  curproc->completion_time = old_time;\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\n### Why This Matters for \"Multiple exec2()\" Test\nWhen multiple processes call exec2() with different times:\n1. Process A: exec2(100, ...) - short time\n2. Process B: exec2(500, ...) - long time (increased from lower value)\n3. Process B should yield to Process A (shorter time)\n4. Without yield(), Process B continues running despite having longer time\n5. This violates STCF scheduling policy\n\n### Fix Applied\nAdded yield() when new time > old time:\n```c\nint sys_exec2(void) {\n  // ... validation ...\n\n  int old_time = curproc->completion_time;\n  curproc->completion_time = time_to_complete;\n\n  // ✅ Reschedule if time increased\n  if(time_to_complete > old_time) {\n    yield();\n  }\n\n  int result = exec(path, argv);\n  curproc->completion_time = old_time;\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing exec2() Yourself\n\n### Test Programs Created\n\n1. **test_exec2_simple.c** - Basic functionality test\n   - Tests exec2 with time increase (should reschedule)\n\n2. **test_exec2_multi.c** - Multiple processes test\n   - Child 1: exec2(100, ...) - should run first\n   - Child 2: exec2(400, ...) - should run after\n   - Tests concurrent exec2() calls with different times\n\n3. **test_exec2_complex.c** - Comprehensive test\n   - Tests time increase (should yield)\n   - Tests time decrease (should not yield)\n   - Tests multiple concurrent exec2() calls\n   - Verifies STCF scheduling order\n\n### How to Add Test Programs to Makefile\n\nEdit `Makefile` around line 199 and add:\n```makefile\nUPROGS=\\\n\t_cat\\\n\t_echo\\\n\t# ... existing programs ...\n\t_test_exec2_simple\\\n\t_test_exec2_multi\\\n\t_test_exec2_complex\\\n```\n\n### How to Run Tests\n\n```bash\n# Build with STCF scheduler\ncd solution\nmake clean\nmake SCHEDULER=STCF qemu-nox\n\n# In xv6, run:\ntest_exec2_simple\ntest_exec2_multi\ntest_exec2_complex\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFor **test_exec2_complex**:\n1. Child2 (time=200) should run first and complete\n2. Child3 (time=100 after exec2) should run next\n3. Child1 (time=300 after exec2) should run last\n4. Parent (time=1000) runs when children finish\n\n### What to Look For\n\n- ✅ Correct scheduling order (shortest time first)\n- ✅ Processes with increased time yield properly\n- ✅ Processes with decreased time don't yield unnecessarily\n- ✅ exec2() successfully replaces process image\n- ✅ All \"exec2 done\" messages appear (exec succeeded)\n- ❌ \"exec2 FAILED\" messages indicate exec() failed\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n1. **sysproc.c line 164**: Removed redundant `skip_in_scheduler = 0` reset\n2. **sysproc.c lines 153-156**: Added yield() when `time_to_complete > old_time`\n\nThese are minimal changes that fix critical scheduling bugs while maintaining correctness.\n","replaceAll":true}],"supportMultiEdits":false}}

This violates STCF scheduling policy\n\n### Fix Applied\nAdded yield() when new time > old time:\n```c\nint sys_exec2(void) {\n  // ... validation ...\n\n  int old_time = curproc->completion_time;\n  curproc->completion_time = time_to_complete;\n\n  // ✅ Reschedule if time increased\n  if(time_to_complete > old_time) {\n    yield();\n  }\n\n  int result = exec(path, argv);\n  curproc->completion_time = old_time;\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing exec2() Yourself\n\n### Test Programs Created\n\n1. **test_exec2_simple.c** - Basic functionality test\n   - Tests exec2 with time increase (should reschedule)\n\n2. **test_exec2_multi.c** - Multiple processes test\n   - Child 1: exec2(100, ...) - should run first\n   - Child 2: exec2(400, ...) - should run after\n   - Tests concurrent exec2() calls with different times\n\n3. **test_exec2_complex.c** - Comprehensive test\n   - Tests time increase (should yield)\n   - Tests time decrease (should not yield)\n   - Tests multiple concurrent exec2() calls\n   - Verifies STCF scheduling order\n\n### How to Add Test Programs to Makefile\n\nEdit `Makefile` around line 199 and add:\n```makefile\nUPROGS=\\\n\t_cat\\\n\t_echo\\\n\t# ... existing programs ...\n\t_test_exec2_simple\\\n\t_test_exec2_multi\\\n\t_test_exec2_complex\\\n```\n\n### How to Run Tests\n\n```bash\n# Build with STCF scheduler\ncd solution\nmake clean\nmake SCHEDULER=STCF qemu-nox\n\n# In xv6, run:\ntest_exec2_simple\ntest_exec2_multi\ntest_exec2_complex\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFor **test_exec2_complex**:\n1. Child2 (time=200) should run first and complete\n2. Child3 (time=100 after exec2) should run next\n3. Child1 (time=300 after exec2) should run last\n4. Parent (time=1000) runs when children finish\n\n### What to Look For\n\n- ✅ Correct scheduling order (shortest time first)\n- ✅ Processes with increased time yield properly\n- ✅ Processes with decreased time don't yield unnecessarily\n- ✅ exec2() successfully replaces process image\n- ✅ All \"exec2 done\" messages appear (exec succeeded)\n- ❌ \"exec2 FAILED\" messages indicate exec() failed\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n1. **sysproc.c line 164**: Removed redundant `skip_in_scheduler = 0` reset\n2. **sysproc.c lines 153-156**: Added yield() when `time_to_complete > old_time`\n\nThese are minimal changes that fix critical scheduling bugs while maintaining correctness.\n"},"updatedPermissions":[]}}}

Basic exec2 functionality\n2. **test_exec2_multi** - Multiple concurrent exec2 calls\n3. **test_exec2_complex** - Comprehensive scheduling test\n4. **test_exec2_yield** - Tests yield behavior with longer programs\n5. **test_exec2_scheduling** - Exposes missing yield() bug\n\n### Advanced Tests (New - Harder)\n\n#### 6. **test_stcf_stress** - Multi-process stress test\n**What it tests:**\n- 5 children with different behaviors simultaneously\n- exec2() with time increase and decrease\n- give_cpu() calls\n- Multiple remain() calls\n- Verifies scheduler handles complex scenarios\n\n**Key scenarios:**\n- Child decreases time via exec2 (900→50) - should become highest priority\n- Child increases time via exec2 (100→800) - should yield\n- Child uses give_cpu and gets rescheduled\n- Child makes multiple remain() calls with increases/decreases\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nProcesses should run in STCF order after each time change\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **test_stcf_tiebreak** - Tie-breaking verification\n**What it tests:**\n- Multiple processes with IDENTICAL completion times\n- Verifies higher PID runs first (tie-breaking rule)\n\n**Key scenarios:**\n- 4 children all with time=300\n- Should run in reverse fork order (highest PID first)\n\n**Expected order:**\nChild4 → Child3 → Child2 → Child1 (by PID)\n\n**Critical check:**\nIf tie-breaking is wrong, order will be random or incorrect\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **test_stcf_chain** - Nested fork and exec2\n**What it tests:**\n- Parent forks child A\n- Child A forks child B\n- Child B forks child C\n- Child B uses exec2 to increase time\n- Tests cascading scheduling effects\n\n**Key scenarios:**\n- Grandchildren processes\n- exec2 in middle of fork chain\n- Verify scheduler handles nested process trees\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nC(100) runs first, B yields after exec2(700), A(500) runs, B finishes last\n\n---\n\n#### 9. **test_stcf_rapid** - Rapid operations\n**What it tests:**\n- Multiple consecutive remain() calls\n- Multiple consecutive give_cpu() calls\n- Scheduler stability under rapid changes\n\n**Key scenarios:**\n- Child1: 5 rapid remain() calls (increase/decrease)\n- Child2: 3 consecutive give_cpu() calls\n- Child3: Stable process for comparison\n\n**Critical check:**\n- No crashes or deadlocks\n- Correct final scheduling order\n- give_cpu works correctly multiple times\n\n---\n\n#### 10. **test_stcf_edge** - Edge cases\n**What it tests:**\n- Boundary values (MAX_INT completion time)\n- exec2() failure (bad path) - time should restore\n- exec2() with same time (no yield)\n- exec2() with decreased time (no yield)\n- give_cpu when no other process exists\n\n**Key scenarios:**\n1. **Very large time** (0x7FFFFFFE) then decrease\n2. **exec2 failure** - verify time restored to original\n3. **exec2 same time** - should not yield\n4. **exec2 decrease** - should not yield\n5. **give_cpu alone** - should reschedule to self\n\n**Critical checks:**\n- No integer overflow\n- Failed exec2 doesn't break scheduler\n- Correct yield/no-yield behavior\n\n---\n\n#### 11. **test_stcf_interleave** - Interleaved operations\n**What it tests:**\n- Complex combinations of exec2, remain, and give_cpu\n- 4 children with different operation sequences\n- Tests state consistency across operations\n\n**Key scenarios:**\n- Child A: exec2 fails → remain instead\n- Child B: remain → give_cpu\n- Child C: give_cpu → exec2\n- Child D: remain → give_cpu → remain\n\n**Critical check:**\nScheduler maintains STCF invariants despite complex operation sequences\n\n---\n\n## How to Run All Tests\n\n```bash\ncd /home/kuroma/Storage/college/college-comp-sci/CS-537/cs537-projects/p3-old/solution\nmake clean\nmake SCHEDULER=STCF qemu-nox CPUS=1\n```\n\n### Inside xv6, run:\n\n**Basic suite:**\n```\ntest_exec2_simple\ntest_exec2_multi\ntest_exec2_complex\ntest_exec2_yield\ntest_exec2_scheduling\n```\n\n**Advanced suite:**\n```\ntest_stcf_stress\ntest_stcf_tiebreak\ntest_stcf_chain\ntest_stcf_rapid\ntest_stcf_edge\ntest_stcf_interleave\n```\n\n---\n\n## What to Look For\n\n### ✅ Correct Behavior:\n- Processes run in STCF order (shortest completion time first)\n- Higher PID runs first when times are equal\n- exec2() with time increase → yields\n- exec2() with time decrease → no yield\n- give_cpu() → different process runs next\n- Failed exec2() → time restored\n- No crashes, hangs, or panics\n\n### ❌ Bug Indicators:\n\n**Missing yield in exec2:**\n- Process continues running after increasing time\n- Shorter jobs don't preempt\n\n**Race condition in give_cpu:**\n- Process gets rescheduled immediately after give_cpu\n- Non-deterministic behavior\n\n**Tie-breaking wrong:**\n- Lower PID runs first when times equal\n- Random order with equal times\n\n**State corruption:**\n- Time values incorrect after failed exec2\n- Scheduler picks wrong process\n- Completion times not updated properly\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. **First**: Run all tests in p3-old (before fix)\n   -
